Black Men Dont Cheat (instead of the hashtag)
The Faithful Black Men Collective 

Instead of the top-layer image, i'd like a shot of someone holding the memembership card (Like ash ketchum style when he gets a new gym badge). WIll be getting a picture of that soon once i receive the card.

The next session with "Join The Revolution."

I'd like this to portray just the membership card itself. It will be a dual sided card so. If we could display them side by side, with them rotated diagnally maybe?

With the Join Us under them

On the Membership Benefits Section, do you think there would be a way we could display the profile page.

Not sure if it would be best to just link to a dummy profile so they can see, or would a modal that could be openned be best?
